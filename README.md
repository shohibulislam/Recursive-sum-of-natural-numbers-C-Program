# Recursive Sum of Natural Numbers in C

This is a basic C program that calculates the sum of the first `n` natural numbers using a **recursive function**.

## How It Works

The recursive function adds the current number `n` to the sum of all previous numbers, stopping when it reaches 1.

### Input

The user is prompted to enter a positive integer n.
```
Enter your value: 5
```
### Output

The program prints the total sum of the first n natural numbers.
```
The sum of the first 5 natural numbers is: 15
```
